This Interest Rate Calculator project was developed using C# as part of my programming coursework. It allows users to calculate the interest accrued on a principal amount based on the interest rate and time period entered. The project uses basic C# concepts such as variables, data types, arithmetic operations, and user input handling to compute the interest. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in building console applications, implementing formulas, and working with loops and conditionals for user-friendly input validation. The calculator demonstrates the practical use of mathematical calculations in programming, while also emphasizing the importance of clear and efficient code.
